## Install {#checklist}

- Go through our Setup Checklist and install necessary software. If you have concerns or questions, simply download the installers, ready to be installed when needed.

### Accounts that may be useful

All are free.

- [ ] [Github](https://github.com) (Code repository, computations), if you don't already have one.
- [ ] [ORCID](https://orcid.org) (Identity management) - useful in general for academia, can help you sign in to some of the other sites
- [ ] [WholeTale](https://dashboard.wholetale.org/) (computations) - you should be able to use your university login, if not, use ORCID.
- [ ] [CodeOcean](https://codeocean.com/) (computations) - free account, some free computing hours if signing up with academic email.


### Software to install on your laptop

- [ ] Git command line tool ([download the software](https://git-scm.com/downloads), then follow the guide on [Installing Git on your computer](https://github.com/labordynamicsinstitute/ldi-lab-standards/wiki/Setting-up-Git)
- [x] Command line (We will use the "Bash shell", but PowerShell will work, too) 
    - Windows: "Git bash" comes with the Git install above. You could also use [WSL2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) (OPTIONAL, Pro)
    - macOS: Use the "Terminal" app (pre-installed)
    - Linux: Use any "terminal" app (pre-installed)
- [ ] Visual Studio Code ([download location](https://code.visualstudio.com/)), a powerful text editor
    - [ ] Set up [settings sync](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/settings-sync) (OPTIONAL, recommended)
    - [ ] Install Plugins:  [Excel to Markdown table](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=csholmq.excel-to-markdown-table)
    - [ ] Install Plugins:  [Markdown Preview Enhanced](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shd101wyy.markdown-preview-enhanced)
    - [ ] Install Plugins:  [Auto-Open Markdown Preview](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hnw.vscode-auto-open-markdown-preview) (OPTIONAL, can sometimes be inconvenient)
    - [ ] Install Plugins:  [markdownlint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint) will debug your Markdown


Other software is optional. You will use statistical software that you already have access to (if not, please let the instructor know).

### Text editor vs. Word processor

You want to use a **text editor**, not a **word processor**. The difference: a **text editor** creates simple text files, without fancy formatting.

If you are creating code in Stata, Matlab, or Rstudio, you are using a customized text editor, sometimes called an **IDE** = "Integrated Development Environment". That is OK. But remember that all such program code is a straight text file. 

General purpose text editors can view and edit them all, although they may lack some of the fancy features that make programming easier in the dedicated IDE.
