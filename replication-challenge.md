# Replication Challenge

## Goals

The Replication Challenge starts with a reproduced article, or an attempt to reproduce an article. It then proposes an enhancement or improvement, in line with the [ACRE Guide list of Improvements](https://bitss.github.io/ACRE/improvements.html)

## Acceptance to start

The first step is an accepted reproducibility report. The report will be reviewed to ensure that failure to reproduce is not due to replicator error, but rather is a fact in the original package. The reproducibility report will be made public.

## Acceptance of final deliverable

The final deliverable should satisfy certain criteria in order to be eligible for the final payment of the Challenge:

- at a minimum, the replication should be push-button reproducible. It should have a single controller file (`main.do`, `principal.py`, etc.) driving the analysis.
  - an exception is when data needs to be downloaded. This should be clear to the replicator. For internal assessment, the data should be provided to the Marie and Lars (Dropbox, Drive, capsules)
- the replication package should have a README, separate from the original authors' README, detailing the necessary steps, and the changes and enhancements made
  - Referencing a Git log or similar for the changes is acceptable. A summary of the changes should be provided.
- the replication package should be deposited in a public repository (Github is fine for this case, Dataverse, CodeOcean, Zenodo are acceptable as well), with a public license no more restrictive than the original authors' license.
  - For users of WholeTale, exporting to Dataverse or Zenodo is the way to go.

The Replication Challenge Team (Lars, Marie, Abel) will assist replicators to achieve this outcome, see timeline.
