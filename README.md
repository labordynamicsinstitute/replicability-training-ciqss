Prior to Training
------

Please have a look at the [list of pre-training tasks](pre-training-tasks) that should be accomplished before the first meeting. 

---

Tentative Agenda
----------------

The training will start with an intensive day-and-half of lectures/discussions, followed by exercises that you will do on your own, with daily touch-base meetings.

Items that are **bolded** are live lectures. Items that are *italicized* are in informal groups, but live. Other items are on your own time, but the time slot is the suggested time you should be doing them. 

> You should have received an invitation to register for the Zoom. If you have not, contact the trainer.
